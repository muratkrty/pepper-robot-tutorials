# Quick Webots installation guide for Linux (Ubuntu)

1. Click [here](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installing-the-tarball-package) for information on Webots and its installation. 

2. Download the .tar.bz2 package [here](https://cyberbotics.com/#download) and move it into your preferred installation directory.

3. Open a command line window in the same directory and use

`$ tar xjf webots-R2020a-rev2-x86-64.tar.bz2`

(pay attention to the right file name).

# Start Webots

1. Open a command line window in the directory in which the "webots" folder is lying and type
 
`$ webots/webots`

(For some reason, neither "$ export WEBOTS_HOME=/home/username/webots" nor opening a command line in the actual webots folder and then calling webots from there is working for me. Lea)
